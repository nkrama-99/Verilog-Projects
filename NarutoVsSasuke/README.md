A game based on famous anime characters: Naruto and Sasuke. Both the graphics and logic of this game were developed from scratch on verilog by my partner and I. It is one of our very first projects on verilog and we are happy that we made a game based on an anime which we're both passionate about.

The concept of the game is simple - dodge the attacks! And, the scoring and game over concept is similar to that of Flappy Bird.
